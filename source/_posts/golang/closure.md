1 ## What's Go closure?

In Go, a closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) function's scope. The closure "closes over" the variables, meaning that it retains access to them even after the outer function has returned. This makes closures a powerful tool for encapsulating data and functionality and for creating reusable code.
