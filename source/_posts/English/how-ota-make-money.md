Hello everyone, this is **Explorer Informed**, and in this **episode**, we'll try to answer how online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia or Booking.com make money. In our previous episode, we **explored** whether booking a **packaged vacation** on Expedia saves you money compared to **booking each component of your trip separately**, and we found that there are generally savings to be had in a **package deal**. So, how do online travel agencies make their money? There are three primary business models that they employ:

- **Merchant Model** - In this model, an OTA purchases hotel rooms or other bookings in advance at a discount and then sells them back to customers at a higher price.
- **Agency Model** - Here, an OTA acts as a salesperson and **facilitates** bookings between customers and travel suppliers such as hotels and airlines, and in return receives a **commission** or fee.
- **Advertising and Other Revenue** - OTAs make money from advertising to the millions of visitors using their services or from **subsidiaries** like home-sharing companies or restaurant reservation platforms.

Let's take a closer look at how two OTAs - Expedia Group and Booking Holdings - use these three business models. Depending on where you live, you may be more familiar with one over the other, but **together they make up a huge chunk of the online travel market**.

Expedia Group includes Expedia, Hotels.com, Trivago, HomeAway, VRBO, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire, and several others. The **portfolio** of Booking Holdings is a little smaller but includes Booking.com, Kayak, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and OpenTable.

Both Expedia and Booking have three main channels to generate revenue: merchant model, agency model, and advertising. In the merchant model, OTAs purchase hotel rooms or other bookings in advance at a discount and **sell them over time** at a higher price. For instance, let's consider this example - Pretend Expedia uses **their purchasing power** to book a block of 50 rooms at a **popular resort** for $100 per night, while the current **market rate** is around $150 per night. Since they are booking 50 rooms at a time, they are getting a **volume discount**. Expedia resells the rooms over time at a higher rate, say $135, but that's still lower than the current market rate, which we will assume has risen to $170 since Expedia first booked the 50 room block. In this way, Expedia makes money by selling these rooms at a higher rate than they purchased them for and presents savings to customers over the current market rate.

In the agency model, OTAs act as a facilitator and never collect the customer's money. Instead, they help customers to book hotel rooms, rental cars, or airline tickets and receive a commission or fee from the supplier. For instance, if a customer makes a hotel booking through Booking.com, Booking.com will pass that reservation to the hotel, and the hotel will pay a commission back to Booking.com. In the 10k report of Booking.com in 2018, they explain that most of their agency revenues come from these commission payments, but there are also some booking and insurance fees as well.

Finally, OTAs also make money from advertising and other revenue. Expedia sells a lot of advertising to both travel and non-travel companies on their Trivago platform, which is a price comparison platform focused on the hotel market. Another of Expedia's other revenue sources is HomeAway, their vacation rental and home-sharing platform that includes VRBO. Expedia earns both per transaction commissions as well as service fees through HomeAway. Meanwhile, Booking Holdings has seen recent growth from Agoda in international markets, which is one of their growing platforms largely focused on accommodations
