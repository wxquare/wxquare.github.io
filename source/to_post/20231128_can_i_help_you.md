ordering catering,--
food hello can I help you hi I'd like to order catering for a,--
party can you provide me with the date and time of your,--
event yes it's on Saturday at 700 p.m. and how many guests are you,--
expecting around 20,--
guests what type of event is it it's a birthday,--
party what Specialties do you recommend for a small party I recommend,--
finger foods like sliders mini kiches and skewers they're easy to eat and,--
perfect for sharing that sounds great I'll have that,--
what about dessert for dessert you can't go wrong,--
with cupcakes or mini cheesecakes they're small enough to enjoy without,--
feeling too full I'd like mini,--
cheesecakes I was thinking of having a vegetarian option we have two yes who,--
are vegetarians what do you suggest for a vegetarian option we have,--
a delicious roasted vegetable and hummus wrap it's a crowd,--
baser that sounds perfect what about drinks for drinks we have a variety of,--
options you can choose from soda juice or lemonade,--
we also have a selection of beer and wine if you'd like to serve,--
alcohol soda lemonade and beer sounds perfect how much food and drink should I,--
order for 20 people for finger foods I recommend,--
ordering 8 to 10 pieces per person for dessert four to six pieces per person,--
should be enough and for drinks two to three servings per,--
person okay I'll love that and what is your budget per person,--
around $30 per person perfect we can definitely work,--
with that budget can you tell me if there are any food allergies that I need,--
to be aware of yes we have one guest who has a nut,--
[Music],--
allergy noted we'll make sure that none of the dishes contain,--
[Applause],--
nuts at the Farmers,--
Market hi what can I get for you hi there I'm,--
looking to buy a few things today but first could I ask your advice about,--
fish of course I'm having a dinner party and,--
want to serve fish but I'm unsure what to choose is there a variety that most,--
people like or sorts to avoid it depends on your guess but white,--
fish is a safer option it's not quite as fishy it has a,--
milder taste great are there any white fish you'd,--
recommend there is the usual Cod and hack another great choice is,--
bass which is great fried in butter oh okay I think I've had bass,--
before and I loved it I think I'll go for that please can I have six portions,--
of bass no problem let me get those,--
[Music],--
packaged for,--
you that'll be,--
[Music],--
$9.50 here you go thank,--
you hi I need some chicken but what kind is best for a,--
curry hi there are two types you can choose from chicken breasts are the,--
usual option but you could also try chicken thigh,--
Del personally I think the thighs are much tastier they're also juicier,--
because it's almost impossible to overcook them they're also slightly,--
cheaper sounds great I'd love to give them a go can I have 500 G of the,--
chicken thigh fets,--
absolutely lastly could I have 450 G of stewing steak with this cold weather on,--
the way it's time for a good hearty casserole I couldn't agree more is that,--
everything today yes thank,--
you no problem that's $10.8 alog,--
[Music],--
together fantastic thank you so,--
much Plumbing,--
issues hey there I'm the plumber I heard you're having some Plumbing issues what,--
seems to be the problem Oh yes please please come in my,--
sink and bathtub are clogged and my shower head is,--
leaking also the water pressure in my bathroom sink is,--
[Music],--
low okay let me take a look and see what's going,--
on ah I see what's going on here your sink,--
and bathtub are clogged with hair and soap scum that's causing the low water,--
pressure too oh I had no idea what about the,--
shower head your shower head is leaking because,--
the rubber washer inside has worn out it's a quick and easy,--
fix that's a relief what can I do to prevent these issues from happening in,--
the future you can use a drain strainer in,--
your sink and shower to catch hair air and,--
debris it's also essential to clean your drains and pipes regularly to prevent,--
clogs thanks for the advice I'll make sure to do that from now,--
